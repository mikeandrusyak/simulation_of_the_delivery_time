    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the probability that a parcel sent from a German distribution hub to the Basel Gateway arrives on time (within two days), considering potential delays caused by weather disruptions, labor strikes, and network congestion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation:\n",
    "Standard parcel logistics assume a delivery time of two working days under normal conditions. However, disruptions in the delivery chain such as strong weather events, infrastructure congestion during peak shopping periods, and labor strikes can significantly alter this. By simulating these risks, we aim to quantify the likelihood of delay, and identify which risk factors most significantly impact delivery reliability.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Method for Modeling Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, discrete distributions are used primarily (mainly Bernoulli distributions) because we model whether an event occurs or not (binary outcomes). Some uniform random integer distributions are also used to approximate delay durations.\n",

    "**Independent events**  are modeled using **Bernoulli distributions** with fixed occurrence probabilities.\n",

    "- Relevant disruption events are triggered randomly according to their probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The resulting delivery delays are aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total delivery times are statistically analyzed.\n",

    "- The result is contextualized and commented to make statements about the distribution of delivery times and to assess the risk of significant delays\n",

    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation results will be analyzed as follows:\n",

    "- Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, variance, and percentiles of delivery duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scenario comparison: Impact analysis of individual events or event combinations compared to the baseline scenario.\n",
