This imbalance results in reduced efficiency, causing delays in processing, sorting, and delivering parcels.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Parcels are viewed as customers in a queue awaiting service (sorting, loading, transport). Logistical overload occurs when the \"arrival rate\" of parcels exceeds the \"service rate,\" creating a backlog. Commonly modeled using distributions like the Poisson distribution (for arrivals) and Exponential distribution (for service times). Performance metrics include expected waiting time, queue length, and system utilization.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Models logistical systems as networks of nodes (distribution centers) and edges (transport routes).\n",
    "    Overload is modeled as exceeding node capacities or bottlenecks along routes.\n",
    "    Optimization methods (e.g., linear programming, simulation) assess capacity constraints and suggest system adjustments."
